Student Management System project is written in Python. The project file contains a python script (student.py).  Talking about the system, it contains basic functions which include Add students, view students, search students and remove the student.  

While adding the students, the user only has to enter his/her name then the system adds the record and displays to the user. And the user can view all these students lists from the view section. In this Simple Student Management, the user can also search for student’s name in order to know whether the student’s record exists in the system or not. This Student Management system provides the simplest management of student’s list.
